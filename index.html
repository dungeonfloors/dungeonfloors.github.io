You wake up in a room. Its pitch black. You hear a buzz, like there is static. You eyes start to adjust and you notice that you are not alone in this small room. What would you like to do.
Your options are: Investigate other person, search room, check inventory
Investigate other person: He seems as if he is a thief, ragged clothing, cuts and bruises, no shoes.
Your options are: Investigate closer, Search room, check inventory, Wake him up
Investigate closer: On further inspection you notice he has a pouch. In the pouch you see a small potion, a light dagger, and 40 GP
Your options are: Take loot, leave him alone, kill him (if he has checked his inventory), Wake him up.
Kill him: You kill him and take his loot.
Wake him up: You wake him up. His eyes are groggy, but once he sees you he looks terrified. “Who are you?! Where are we?!” he says. (Roll D20 plus charisma, 1 - 10 = Fail, 11 - 20 = Success)
Fail: You say “I don’t know anything, just follow me and shut up.” He is more scared than when you started talking. His trust in you is low but he listens.
Success: You say “Hey, don’t worry ok? I don’t entirely know my name or where we are either. Do you know your name?” “Its Jake. My name is Jake.” he says. “Ok well Jake, we need to help each other out. We need to get out, ok?” “Alright” He seems calmer now. You have gained Jake as a partner.
Search room: You start to look and feel around the room. The longer you have been in the room the better of sight you obtain. You can see and feel that the walls and floor are made of cold stone. When you feel around the room you find three holes in the wall. To small for your hands to fit in them but maybe someone smaller. You decide to leave it alone and search around more. You find where the static sound is coming from. Its a TV with a box underneath it.
Your options are: Investigate box, Check Inventory, Investigate other person
Investigate Box: You inspect the box and find that it is a dvd player. It has a disk on top.
Play the disk: go to next page
Check inventory: You check your inventory, (dependant on class) YOU MAY NOW CHOOSE YOUR CLASS
Your options are: Smarts, Strength, Stealth
Smarts: When you check your inventory you find 50 GP. When you dig into the deeper pockets you find an almost broken wooden staff and a book. The book is locked up with unbreakable chains and no lock pad. It confuses you.
Strength: When you check your inventory you find 25 GP. When searching more you get annoyed and start to shake your bag upside-down to get everything out. When you are done you find a sharpened short sword made of bronze. It looks flimsy and as if it will break easily. You also find cloth gloves, you put them on. (+1 strength)
Stealth: When you check your inventory you find 60 GP. You search more and find (Role D6 dice, 1 - 3 = short bow, 4 - 6 = short dagger), (if got bow, roll two D6 again for how many arrows)
	You play the disk. The TV turns on and starts to play the disk. It starts off black but then shows a finger hitting the lens. He clears his throat. He appears to be a child. He seems to be looking at you directly. He speaks, “Hi and welcome to the first floor of my game. This is the first challenge as well so good luck. To put it simply for why you are here, because I know you all are confused, you signed up for a game a while ago. You were chosen out of the many others for being the best of the best in your area. Now there is a catch. If you die in this game, you die in real life. There is no other choice. We have been taking care of you in this chamber while you were asleep making sure that you all stay alive. I hope all 5 of you are still alive.” You look around the room and you do not see any dead bodies only Jake. You are a little confused. The TV continues, “You can count me as your god. At all times I will be surveying you. Now onto the puzzle.” There is a loud metallic screech. “ Once this video ends the room will be filled up with poisonous gas. You all will have ONE AND A HALF MINUTES to find the key to get out. Just know its not always what you think. Good luck, and try not to die out there. Bye bye…” The TV fades to black and gas starts filling the room. The timer begins, NOW.

Correct solution:
Check the 1st hole in the wall with Jake to grab the note
The note reads “You are not capable of reading this” 
Make Jake read it. When Jake reads it, it says “The key is in the DVD player”
Break the DVD player
Grab the note inside. (Give players the note)
The note says, “READ ALOUD, An army of one is not capable of greatness. But an army of two with a great leader is capable of conquering the world”
Once a player reads the note go on with the story.

IF THE PLAYERS FAIL THEN RESTART FROM THE BEGINNING

	You recite the words on the page and you hear gears shifting. The door slowly starts to open from the bottom. The both of you get worried and crawl under the first opening you get. You look up to see trees, a river, a bridge and the sky. Its so bright. It feels like it’s the first time you have ever felt light. You feel safe, FOR NOW.

FROM NOW ON ALL DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN 10 SECONDS AND ARE FINAL!!!

	You decide to follow the trail over to the forest. You notice that there are huge mushrooms. You step onto a vine and you and Jake fly up into the sky. You sprung a trap! You quickly try to recover from this when you realize, you are in a city of Tree Nymphs and Elves! They speak to you. (check sheet for languages)

If they do not speak elvish: “Which bodui are cin raised o! Are cin uin arat tribe ben uin duin tribe!” (Roll one D20 + Charisma, 1-15 fail, 16-20 success.)
Fail: You try to convince them you are not involved but they do not believe you. They decide to cut you down and bring you to their prison. Once in there, you and Jake decide to call it a day

Success: continue

	You manage to pick up some words in their language. You find that they are talking about tribes, so you quickly respond back, “No im neither. I am not from anywhere near here. I was on my way through your village when I stumbled upon a trap. I apologize.” They look at each other in confusion. Back at you, and stare in concern. “You are not from here then how did you make it in through the barrier”. “Honestly I don’t even know where we are at all. All I know is that we need to make it to the final floor.” The citizens look surprised this would be a prime time to escape.
	Your options are:
Attempt to escape the trap and run: You try to escape from the trap. You fall to the ground and take 5 damage. You run knowing that there has to be around 15 elves chasing you down. You can either stand and attack, continue running, or stop and be imprisoned
Attack: Go into attack stages
Run: You keep running. Slowly but surely you build more of a distance. You feel safe, until you realize that the Nymphs were surrounding you with roots. When the Elves get there they tie you up and bring you to imprisonment.
Accept Imprisonment: The Elves catch up to you. When they do they bring you to their prison chambers.
Stay in the trap: The elves and nymphs talk amongst each other for a while and then nod. “We are going to put you in the chambers for tonight until we find what to do with you.” you accept this and sigh with relief. When they bring you down and untie you they bring you to a prison gently. When you get in the prison you decide to call it a day.
